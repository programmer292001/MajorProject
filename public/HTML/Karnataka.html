                The South Indian State of Karnataka is flanked by Andhra Pradesh and Telegana in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west, Maharashtra and Goa in the north and northwest, and the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south. Karnataka is a land of sheer diversity; be it Heritage, Culture, Nature, Beaches or Wildlife. Karnataka is primarily known for its Heritage destinations and its Wildlife/ National Parks.  Apart from that, it is also famous for its magical hill stations, spectacular waterfalls, pilgrimage centres and a 320km long coastline dotted with un-spoilt beaches. Thus, making it an ideal place for a traveller with diverse interests.
                A land known for its silks, spices and sandalwood, Karnataka adds up as an experience to remember for a lifetime. Tourism in Karnataka stands out with its diverse offerings that include wildlife & national parks, monuments & heritage sites, beaches and pilgrimage sites. Yet another notable point is that tourist attractions in Karnataka are located at geographically extreme ends which interestingly make the capital Bengaluru (Silicon Valley of India), the focal point of tour itineraries.
