               India is a vast country with a lot to offer. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that millions of people pay India a visit every year. The country offers a variety of sights and sounds to enjoy, from the vibrant cities to the peaceful countryside. With its diversity of tourist attractions, India is also known for yoga and meditation. From the snow-capped Himalayas to the tropical beaches of Goa, from the wildlife of Assam to the largest tea field of Kerala, there is something new in every corner of this country. Moreover, with major cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, and Delhi being so well connected by air, road, and rail networks from across the globe, itâ€™s easy to get around and explore some of the most iconic landmarks in India.
